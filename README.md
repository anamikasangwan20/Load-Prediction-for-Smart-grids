# Load-Prediction-for-Smart-grids

This project is a part of my research work at the Data Science Lab. </br> 
Code: </br>
The preprocess.py file extracts time series from the csv files and puts them into Python dataframes </br> 
The baselines.py file implements ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for predicting customer load data into the future
