# Load-Prediction-for-Smart-grids

This project is a part of my research work at the Data Science Lab at University of Southern California </br> </br>
Code: </br>
The preprocess.py file extracts monthly data from csv files and converts it into 4 dataframes: a) solar load b) AMI Net load c) CL load d) Gencap </br> 
The baselines.py file implements ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to predict the AMI Net load
